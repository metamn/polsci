    We offer a one-year Master of Arts (MA) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) programs in Political Science registered by the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York (US) for and on behalf of the New York State Education Department. Our two-year MA program is accredited by the Hungarian Accreditation Committee of the Ministry of Education since October 2007.
    </p>
    <p>
    The Department of Political Science provides a comprehensive program of instruction and research in the fundamental areas of the discipline: political institutions and processes; the origins, development and transformation of theory and concepts; understanding different approaches to political analysis; political philosophy; social theory; political economy; public policy; political and economic sociology; constitutionalism and the legal contexts necessary for understanding politics and debates about it.
    </p>
    <p>
    The cognitive skills the department seeks to impart include the employment of different methods of analysis and critical thinking. Use of these will enable students to deepen and broaden their knowledge of politics and to articulate their own ethical stance on issues studied. The department strives to develop and nurture a scholarly community of faculty and students who engage in a common process of education and research, with emphasis on understanding the problems and challenges contemporary political communities and their citizens face.
